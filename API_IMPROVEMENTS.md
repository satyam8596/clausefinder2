# API Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the API routes in the ClauseFinder application.

## 1. API Key Management

- **Added fallback API key**: Implemented a fallback to the hardcoded API key when environment variable is not set
- **Created .env.local file**: Added proper environment variable storage for better security
- **Documentation**: Added code comments about API key locations

## 2. Input Validation

- **Enhanced validation**: Added comprehensive validation for text and filename inputs
- **Empty document check**: Added validation to prevent empty or whitespace-only documents
- **Short document check**: Added minimum content length validation (50 characters)
- **Type checking**: Added type checking to ensure inputs are strings

## 3. Error Handling

- **Improved error responses**: Created more specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- **API response validation**: Added validation of the Gemini API response to ensure it's meaningful
- **Error categorization**: Added status code handling for different types of errors (400, 429, 500)
- **Detailed logging**: Enhanced console logging for better debugging

## 4. Response Processing

- **Response validation**: Added checks to ensure the generated analysis contains required sections
- **Empty response handling**: Added detection and handling of empty or too short responses
- **Section extraction validation**: Added validation to ensure minimum viable section extraction

## 5. Testing

- **Test API endpoint**: Added a `/api/test` endpoint to verify API infrastructure
- **Test script**: Created `test-api.js` to test all API functionality
- **Documentation**: Added detailed API documentation in `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`

## 6. Code Organization

- **Code comments**: Added detailed comments explaining the purpose of each section
- **Deprecated warning**: Added warning about the deprecated `extractMarkdownSections` function in `gemini.ts`
- **Function reuse**: Ensured the robust implementation from `markdownUtils.ts` is used throughout

## 7. Performance and Reliability

- **Request timeout**: Implemented 60-second timeout for API requests
- **Text truncation**: Added automatic truncation for documents exceeding maximum length
- **Fallback responses**: Enhanced error fallbacks to provide meaningful feedback even during failures
